How to use:
Drop the object into a room and it will work!
You can create the object through code!
as long as the object is in the room/created, it shall work!

When you press enter, the global.text_input_output variable will be whatever was typed in
you can change this if you wish,

The input system requires a font for it to work correctly, by default the font
fnt_text_input is set to arial, you can change what font it is, but it requires some kind of font to work.

Hope you enjoy!
