# Babel: A Comically Large Tower, Built By Man, Destroyed By God, In Demonstration Of Humanities Hubris
## A Tower Stacking Jam Game.


This is a Game Maker Studio game that I created over the course of 96 hours in late 2021 for the GMC community game jam #42.
[See result topic on the forum](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/gmc-jam-42-results.89485/). The game ended up in 7th place out of 33.

As with most jam games this project was put together incredibly quickly under stressful circumstances, 
and the code quality reflects that. It's not intended to be good or well written code wise, 
all it needed was to work more often than not once sent out to the world. 

It had a bit of further work put in to it and was eventually published to Opera GXC, and lives [at this link](https://gxc.gg/games/53135680-2510-4825-93f2-d385a790f260/). However I at no point had source control for this until now when I uploaded it all in one single swoop, so distinguishing between the old game as it was entered in to the jam and the new game as uploaded to GXC is not easily done. 

The highscore server is provided by the [GMC Jam Server](https://github.com/MagnusMagnusson/GMC_Jam_Server), which is another project I made around my jam entries. However it is due to being replaced sometime in 2022. 

If you load it up in Game Maker Studio 2 you may get a warning or error about missing music titled "snd_myth" or something to that manner. That would be the music that 
is playing under the game which I don't have license to redistribute even if I do have the license to have it in my game on GCX. Just remove references to it until it compiles.
